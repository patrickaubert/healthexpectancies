#' Forecasts prevalences of disability and DFLEs
#'
#' Given a table for the reference year with mortality rates and prevalences of disability, and
#' a projection table with mortality rates, the function calculates prevalences and disability-free
#' life expectancies.
#'
#' Projection hypotheses can be one of the following:
#' * 'cstDFLE' : disability-free life expectancies constant in all year
#' * 'cstDLE' : in-disability life expectancies constant in all year
#' * 'cstPreval' : prevalences by age (and sex) constant in all year
#' * 'cstPctDFLE' : share of disability-free life expectancy in total life-expectancy constant
#'
#' @param tabref  a data frame for the reference year, containing variables: year, age, qx (mortality rate) and pix (prevalences) (+ optional: sex)
#' @param tabproj a data frame for projection years, containing variables: year, age, and qx (mortality rate) (+optional: sex)
#' @param hypo projection hypotheses ('cstDFLE','cstDLE','cstPreval','cstPctDFLE')
#' @param includevars a vector of names of variables that must be included in the output table (otherwise, only pix, ex, DFLEx, DLEx and pctDFLEx are kept)
#'
#' @return a data frame with prevalences, DFLE, DLE and share of DFLE in total LE, by year and age (and optionnally sex)
